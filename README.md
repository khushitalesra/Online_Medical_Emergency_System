# Online_Medical_Emergency_System

The main idea of this work is to provide ease and comfort to patients while 
taking appointment from doctors.
The project is an implementation of an online doctor patient management with 
appointment booking and some added medical features. Patients are 
allowed to book empty slots online and those slots are reserved in their name. It manages 
the appointment data for multiple doctors. Each time a user visits a doctor his/her medical 
entry is stored in the database by doctor. Patients will be given the details of the doctor 
including his schedule and availability on doctorâ€™s permission. Doctor can either keep his 
schedule private or public. The system also consists of Blood donor module. This module 
allows for Blood donation registration as well as Blood group search. The module is 
designed to help urgent Blood requirements through easy/instant searches.
